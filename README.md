# Sequential Color Tone Analysis of Movies

This program takes a sequence of images spit out by ffmpeg representing frames for every second of any movie. 
It then averages the color of each frame, makes a line for each image, and merges the lines together to make a sequential portrait
of how a movie's color and tone changes throughout the movie. 

Here are some examples, I would like to integrate everything into python and bypass ffmpeg once I can figure that out. For now though it seems to be working quite well, the biggest time constraint is the ffmpeg coversion from video to all the still images.  

They look quite beautiful as well as being interesting, and they work as a wallpaper for a computer monitor very well.
